    Please import the .rubbi.sh file in your profile configuration or add its content directly
    
     . #{(share/"alias")}/.rubbi.sh
    
    or the .rubbi.minimal.sh for a minimal setup (rbsh shell function only)
    
     . #{(share/"alias")}/.rubbi.minimal.sh
    
    This tool is based on some alias and shell functions that are core to work.
